# QASM-Bench

## OVERVIEW

QSAM-Bench is a quantum-software bencmark suite that helps evaluate quantum volumes and performance of quntum computers and simulators registered as backends in QISKit API. 

## Getting Started

### Setup QISKit

see https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py/#installation

### Generate QASM files

Each directory has a .py file to generate qasm files.
You can generate a qasm file by specifying qubit with `-n` (and depth with `-d`).
For example, 30 qubits QFT is generated with following commands:
```
$ cd qft;
$ python3 qft.py -n 30
$ cat qft_n30.qasm
```

### Run benchmarks

You can run benchmark `run_simbench.py` with following options.

* `-a`: specify an appplication to be evaluated
* `-b`: specify a backend supportted by QISKit or ProjectQ and Qsharp
* `-s`: specify a qubit number to start evaluation
* `-e`: specify a qubit number to end evaluation
* `-d`: specify a depth to be evaluated (optional)
* `-v`: verify simulation results (optional)
* `-l`: show the list of benchmark scenario (optional)

For example, the following commands run qft from 10 to 20 qubit with local_qiskit_simulator.
```
$ python3 run_simbench.py -a qft -b local_qiskit_simulator -s 10 -e 20
``` 

If you install Q# or ProjectQ on your host, you can run the benchmark on them.
```
$ python3 run_simbench.py -a qft -b Qsharp -s 10 -e 20
$ python3 run_simbench.py -a qft -b ProjectQ -s 10 -e 20
``` 

## Applications

### Fourier Transform

### Quantum Volume
Generate randomized circuits for Quantum Volume analysis.

### SAT
This is a set of SAT (satisfiability) problem instances of [DIMACS](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html) CNF (conjunctive normal form) format with corresponding quantum Grover's search programs. Please note that all SAT instances are randomly generated, with no guarantee of having satisfying solutions.
Original script files to generate sat is https://github.com/hushaohan/cnf (Author: Shaohan Hu / shaohan.hu@ibm.com)

### Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm
This program is based on the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm in the [QISKit-tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/stable/index.ipynb).

### Counterfeit-Coin Finding algorithm
This program is based on the Counterfeit-Coin Finding algorithm in the [QISKit-tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/stable/index.ipynb).
